Contribution
============

Any contribution is more than welcome :heart:.
Just fill an issue_ or a `pull request`_ and we will check ASAP!

Before start contributing
-------------------------

- Make sure you agree to contribute your code under
  `deepskin` license_.

- If you are going to fix a bug, check that it's still exists
  and that you are working with the latest version of
  `deepskin` library.

- Make sure that there is not someone working on the same issue.
  In this case you can provide support or suggestion in the issue.

- If you have any question about the library fill an issue with
  the same criteria described in the previous step.

can be processed as quickly as possible
