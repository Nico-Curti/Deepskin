This is an open-source python package for the analysis of
wound images acquired via smartphone camera.

With this package we aim to propose a new reference for
Wound Image Analysis given by the automated segmentation
of wound area framework, combined with a series of image
processing algorithm for the quantification of clinical
outomes.

The package supports the feature extraction of 2D images
and can be used to calculate features according
to different classes.

.. note::

   **Not intended for clinical use.**
