    "### Active Semi-Supervised Learning training strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we will show how to perform an active semi-supervised learning strategy for the training of a deep learning neural network which aims to perform the wound segmentation on smartphone images.\n",
    "In this demo we will set generic folders for the images and related masks, which mimic as much as possible the original Deepskin dataset.\n",
    "Thus, the proposed code is ready-to-use with your custom dataset and it could be easily adapted also for other segmentation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used for the image segmentation is a classical EfficientNet-b3 architecture, which is already implemented in the `deepskin` Python package.\n",
    "The detailed description about the model architecture could be found in the work of Curti et al. [1](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/1/706).\n",
    "\n",
    "We used Tensorflow library for the model implementation, so be sure to have installed all the required package before the use of this script.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to import the required libraries and define the common variables and path for the use of the segmentation model.\n",
    "The below script could be used for **all** the ASSL rounds of training, with minimum chaning in the below global variables.\n",
    "Take care about the code comments for the correct usage of the script in different rounds.\n",
    "You must take care about the folder tree in which the data (images and masks) are stored.\n",
    "In this demo we assume a folder tree described as:\n",
    "\n",
